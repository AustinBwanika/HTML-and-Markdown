 This is a description of one of my playlists.
 
 What is a photo but a frozen memory engraved in a certain amount of pixels. A picture is worth of thousand words as they hold the sentiment and the emotions of a past self that only the artist and the model behind the picture can really describe what’s going on. The model here is a person who feels natural in their self and are comfortable with doing what may seem to others as unnatural but normal for her. The image screams at me how happiness makes us act which is specific to ourselves and not weary what others may think. This image was taken a long time ago I look back at it when I think that I need to change who I am for others and remember that happiness comes from what you enjoy and what I enjoy is music so the idea to create a playlist to embody what I feel felt like the appropriate course of action so as you listen remember that don’t change who you are to please others but do what makes you feel happy.
