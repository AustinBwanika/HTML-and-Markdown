Welcome to my Page !

###### This page was created by Austin B 

This page was created to help show the skills I learnt during my Internship to show the different aspects of my life through the use 
of different links to the files that i made 

1. The first one I did is of an [image](image.md) to represent how I am searching for what I am going to do in the future 

2. The second one I made is of a page with [links](links.md) that would take a person to another link that would then take you to my 
my music accounts and it holds a description to my playlist "Throwback"

3. The third one is a page filled with [text](text.md) that holds a draft personal statement I made a few weeks ago 

4. the Next one is one of my favourite because it is a [table](table.md) with the my name, an imaginery name and the name of the Shelby 
from the Hit series the "Peaky Blinders"

5. The final piece of work was where I made a [list](lists.md) from a random sentence that I was making.

Enjoy the page!
